# Puzzle 2 

```shell
00      34      CALLVALUE
01      38      CODESIZE
02      03      SUB
03      56      JUMP
04      FD      REVERT
05      FD      REVERT
06      5B      JUMPDEST
07      00      STOP
08      FD      REVERT
09      FD      REVERT
```

1. `CODESIZE` - This opcode measures the size of our code in bytes.
2. `SUB` - takes 2 items from the top of the stack `s[-2]`, `s[-1]` and perform substration `s[-2] - s[-1]`.

Solution : Puzzle 2

Let's See First We see the `CALLVALUE` and `CODESIZE` we need to add `CALLVALUE` and `CODESIZE` given which is `a` in hex which is `10` in dec and then sub `CODESIZE - CALLVALUE` our target destination is instruction 6 so we want to make sure our `CODESIZE - CALLVALUE` = 6 then `CALLVALUE` will be 4.
