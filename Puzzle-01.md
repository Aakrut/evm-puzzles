1. `CALLVALUE` - is similar to the msg.value take value in wei.
2. `JUMP` - It takes a single argument, which is the destination of the jump.

If we do not pass the correct `CALLVALUE` then it will revert, let's see our target is to get to the `JUMPDEST` which is instruction 8 and so put the `CALLVALUE` as the 8 you will `JUMP` to the instruction 8.
