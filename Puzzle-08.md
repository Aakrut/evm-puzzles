1. `SWAP5` - Exchange 1st and 6th stack items.
2. `GAS` - Get the amount of available gas, including the corresponding reduction for the cost of this instruction.
3. `CALL` - Message-call into an accoun, It takes 7 input arguments üëáüèª
    - gas: amount of gas to send to the sub context to execute. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one.
    - address: the account which context to execute.
    - value: value in wei to send to the account.
    - argsOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the calldata of the sub context.
    - argsSize: byte size to copy (size of the calldata).
    - retOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, where to store the return data of the sub context.
    - retSize: byte size to copy (size of the return data).
If call made successful then it will return 1 otherwise 0.

Solution : Puzzle 8
---
Same as Last But Some Twist, The Solution we need to pass `REVERT` so we can jump to 1A to 1B so  the we make calldata like this. So `EQ` condition statisfy `FD` Opcode(`REVERT`) + 1. and we will get `1B`. 

```shell
PUSH1 FD // REVERT
PUSH1 00 // this will be use as offset
MSTORE8 //  store 1 byte

PUSH1 01 // how many bytes to be returned
PUSH1 00 // offset
RETURN
```
