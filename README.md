# Puzzle 1 

```shell
00      34      CALLVALUE
01      56      JUMP
02      FD      REVERT
03      FD      REVERT
04      FD      REVERT
05      FD      REVERT
06      FD      REVERT
07      FD      REVERT
08      5B      JUMPDEST
09      00      STOP

```
1. `CALLVALUE` - is similar to the msg.value take value in wei.
2. `JUMP` - It takes a single argument, which is the destination of the jump.

Solution : Puzzle 1

If we do not pass the correct `CALLVALUE` then it will revert, let's see our target is to get to the `JUMPDEST` which is instruction 8 and so put the `CALLVALUE` as the 8 you will `JUMP` to the instruction 8.

# Puzzle 2 

```shell
00      34      CALLVALUE
01      38      CODESIZE
02      03      SUB
03      56      JUMP
04      FD      REVERT
05      FD      REVERT
06      5B      JUMPDEST
07      00      STOP
08      FD      REVERT
09      FD      REVERT
```

1. `CODESIZE` - This opcode measures the size of our code in bytes.
2. `SUB` - takes 2 items from the top of the stack `s[-2]`, `s[-1]` and perform substration `s[-2] - s[-1]`.

Solution : Puzzle 2

Let's See First We see the `CALLVALUE` and `CODESIZE` we need to add `CALLVALUE` and `CODESIZE` given which is `a` in hex which is `10` in dec and then sub `CODESIZE - CALLVALUE` our target destination is instruction 6 so we want to make sure our `CODESIZE - CALLVALUE` = 6 then `CALLVALUE` will be 4. 


# Puzzle 3 

```shell
00      36      CALLDATASIZE
01      56      JUMP
02      FD      REVERT
03      FD      REVERT
04      5B      JUMPDEST
05      00      STOP
```

1. `CALLDATASIZE` - Returns the size of the calldata in bytes.

Solution : Puzzle 3
---
Our target destination is at instruction 4 and we need to pass valid `CALLDATASIZE` so we can pass this test (ex. 0xFFEECC calldata size is 3.) but we need to make jump to the instruction 4 so `CALLDATASIZE` need to be 4 `0xAABBCCDD` will be your solution.

# Puzzle 4 

```shell
00      34      CALLVALUE
01      38      CODESIZE
02      18      XOR
03      56      JUMP
04      FD      REVERT
05      FD      REVERT
06      FD      REVERT
07      FD      REVERT
08      FD      REVERT
09      FD      REVERT
0A      5B      JUMPDEST
0B      00      STOP
```

1. `XOR` - takes to values from the top of the stack `s[1]` and `s[0]` and perform bit operation.

Solution : Puzzle 4

You need to know binary bit opeation so you can solve this challenge. First we have need add to `CALLVALUE` and our `CODESIZE` is `c` in (hex which is `12` in dec) and our jump destination is `0a` (binary) `10` (hex) so we  do is convert the `12` which is `1100` in binary and `10` in binary `1010`. and we make xor opeartion `1100 ^ 1010` we will get `0110` which is `6` in dec.`CALLVALUE` will be 6 answer to your puzzle.

# Puzzle 5 

```shell
00      34          CALLVALUE
01      80          DUP1
02      02          MUL
03      610100      PUSH2 0100
06      14          EQ
07      600C        PUSH1 0C
09      57          JUMPI
0A      FD          REVERT
0B      FD          REVERT
0C      5B          JUMPDEST
0D      00          STOP
0E      FD          REVERT
0F      FD          REVERT
```

1. `DUP1` - Duplicate 1st stack item.
2. `MUL` - Take Two top most items from the stack and multiply.
3. `PUSH2` - Place 2 byte item on stack.
4. `EQ` - Returns 1 if the last value on the stack is equal to the previous value, 0 otherwise.
5. `PUSH1` - Place 1 byte item on stack.
6. `JUMPI` - JUMPI is a conditional jump that takes top 2 elements from the stack i.e. destination and condition.

Solution : Puzzle 5

First what we need is `CALLVALUE` that will duplicate and multiply with it (eg. `CALLVALUE` = 16 in `dec` but in `hex` 10 and `DUP1` 16 and we take both value from the stack and multiply becomes `100`) then add back to stack and `PUSH2` will add `0100` (in hex) and `EQ` checks if both the top most items are the same or not if yes then return 1 other wise 0. JUMPI same as JUMP but second position must not be 0 otherwise there will be no jump. Therefor `CALLVALUE` will be 16 answer to your puzzle.

# Puzzle 6 

```shell
00      6000      PUSH1 00
02      35        CALLDATALOAD
03      56        JUMP
04      FD        REVERT
05      FD        REVERT
06      FD        REVERT
07      FD        REVERT
08      FD        REVERT
09      FD        REVERT
0A      5B        JUMPDEST
0B      00        STOP
```

1. `CALLDATALOAD` - It is determined which byte of the data in the calldata will be transferred to the stack.

Solution : Puzzle 6
---
 Our target Destination is `0A` in `hex` (`10` in `dec`) so we need calldata that load `A` in `hex` so we can jump to our destination.

First Let's Play with CALLDATALOAD open this [link](https://www.evm.codes/playground?unit=Wei&callData=0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF&codeType=Mnemonic&code=%27%7E1w0yzz%7E2w31y%27%7E%2F%2F+Example+z%5CnyzCALLDATALOADwzPUSH1+%01wyz%7E_&fork=merge)

and if your run the memonics then it will run `PUSH1 0` and load the calldata which is `ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`
then if you `PUSH1 31` it will request to pull out last 1 byte from the `CALLDATA`.

Back to the Solution, if we want to make jump to `0A` then we need `CALLDATA` that contains only `0A` which is `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000A` answer to your puzzle.
